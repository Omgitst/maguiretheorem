    <h1>Black Maguire Theorem</h1>
    <h2>
        Black Maguire Theorem is basically a joke just like the Maguire Theorem
        <br>it mainly resembles a boy named Elamin and when you were to violate him
        <br>you would use the Black Maguire Theorem rather than the normal Maguire Theorem
        <br>an example of a Black Maguire Theorem violation would be:
        <br>Black Maguire said 2 to the power of 3 is 4,after Elamin would of said that

        below you will be able to see the Black Maguire Theorem equations i have come up with
        <br><br>own goal+stupidity=Elamin
        <br>stupidity*npc=BlackMaguireTheorem
        <br>idiot+stupidity=Elamin
        <br>MaguireTheorem+Elamin=BlackMaguireTheorem
        <br>BlackMaguireTheorem-Elamin=MaguireTheorem
        <br>Elamin+set4=NPC
        <br>NPC=Elamin+set4
        <br>Elamin=smartness-dumbness(negative number expected)
        <br>number of brain cells Elamin has=set+grades
